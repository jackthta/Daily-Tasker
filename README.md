# Daily Tasker
This is a single page web application to help organize your tasks. It was my first project and was built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It functions like a very bare-bones to-do-list and can be improved upon. I'm planning on revamping this project later in the future.
Functionality includes:
- **Personalization via ability to set the task-list name to whatever you want**
- **Archive finished tasks**
- **Real time clock**
