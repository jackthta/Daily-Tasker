# Daily Tasker
This is a single page web application to help organize your tasks. It was my first project and was built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It functions like a very bare-bones to-do-list and can be improved upon. This project was not built with a mobile-first approach and is as responsive as flex-box and grids allow. I do have to admit that I spent way more time into UI/UX than I did with functionality, which is why some components could be better, but aren't. I'm planning on revamping this project later in the future.
Functionality includes:
- **Personalization via ability to set the task-list name to whatever you want**
- **Archive finished tasks**
- **Real time clock**

### Welcome Page
*This was just an idea I had, but didn't know how to implement it. I included it as I may wish to connect the welcome page to the daily task homepage eventually.*
